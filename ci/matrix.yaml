# Each environment below will generate a unique build/test job
# See the "compute-matrix" job in the workflow for how this is parsed and used
# cuda: The CUDA Toolkit version
# os: The operating system used
# cpu: The CPU architecture
# compiler: The compiler to use
#   name: The compiler name
#   version: The compiler version
#   exe: The unverionsed compiler binary name
# gpu_build_archs: The GPU architectures to build for using the syntax of CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES (semi-colon separated list)
# std: The C++ standards to build for
#    This field is unique as it will generate an independent build/test job for each value

# Configurations that will run for every PR
